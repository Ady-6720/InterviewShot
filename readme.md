```typescript
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        const sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum === target) return [left, right];
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return [];
